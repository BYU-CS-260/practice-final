# CS 260 Practice Final Exam

This is a practice final exam for BYU CS 260 Web Programming, published Winter 2020.

The following are rules that are generally in place for the final exam:

To take this exam, you will time yourself for four hours. You may stop the
timer if you need to take a short bathroom or snack break. If an emergency
occurs, please stop the timer and contact me once you've handled the emergency.

You may take this exam on any computer you are comfortable with and in any
location you prefer. The exam is open note and open Internet. You can use any
online material. You can use code I have written and code you have written. The
only restrictions are that:

* you may not talk to others about the exam,

* you may not get help from another person,  and

* you may not copy solutions directly from
sites that provide an exact solution to the problems I give you (e.g. a Stack
Overflow solution).

## A note on time

I do not expect the exam to take you four hours, but am providing extra time because of our stressful semester.

If you have accommodations, please add in your extra time as described in your accommodation letter.

## Starting the final exam

To start the final exam, you can clone this repository. Please make your repository private if you upload it to the Internet, so solutions are not shared.

## Code in this exam

There are three directories with problems for this exam. Each one has its own
README file. Be sure you can get the code that is provided running before
attempting the problem. If you have any difficulty getting the code running that
is provided, please contact me. However, if you have difficulty with your own
code, you should debug it on your own.

The problems are:

| Directory | Focus | Points |
| --------- | ----- | ------ |
|  non-profit  | CSS    | 50     |
| blog    | Vue CLI and calling a REST API | 75 |
| organizer      | Node, Express, Mongo, and creating a REST API | 75 |

Be sure you have Node and Mongo working on your laptop.

You do not need to install anything on Digital Ocean.

## Turn in the Final Exam

To turn in the real final exam, you would do the following:

* **make sure you push all your code to your repository on GitHub**

* submit the URL for your repository in the Final Exam assignment using Canvas

* include a screenshot for each application: (2) screenshots for the non-profit website, showing the top and bottom of the site, (4) screenshots of the blog website, one showing the home page with several blog entries, one showing a single post, one showing the page to create a post, and one showing the about page, and (1) screenshot for the organizer website showing a project with its items

* include a note indicating how long the exam
took you and which parts of each problem you got working. Your time on the exam
does not include the time it takes to write this note and turn it in.
