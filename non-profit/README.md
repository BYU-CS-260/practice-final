# Non-profit

This problem focuses on CSS.

Imagine you are working as a web developer, and a client has asked you to develop a new website for a non-profit organization. Your friend at your company is the web designer, and they have created this design for the client:

![recipe website design](./screenshots/home.png)

## Task

Your manager wants you to code a plain HTML and CSS prototype for the website to show the client you can replicate this look. You do not need to make any links or make any buttons clickable. You do not need to make the site responsive.

**You may not use Google to find a website with this design and then inspect or copy its styles. You need to do this on your own.**

See the main README for screenshots required.

## Resources

Your friend has also provided you with the following:

* All the necessary images in the [images](./images) directory.

* Icons from Font Awesome: [Twitter](https://fontawesome.com/icons/twitter?style=brands), [Linked In](https://fontawesome.com/icons/linkedin-in?style=brands), and [Facebook](https://fontawesome.com/icons/facebook-f?style=brands).

* Google fonts to use: [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) all fonts, at weights 300 and 500.

* Colors to use: #253551 for the blue button and #253551 when hovering over the blue button, with #E0E0DB for the gray background.

Some things you remember from your web programming experience:

* You can use a separate div with absolute positioning for the background photo.

* Flexbox is great for laying out a row of items from left-to-right and from top-to-bottom. You can nest Flexbox divs to combine a row of left to right with one column being top to bottom. You can also nest Flexbox divs to have a row with some items floating left and others floating right.

* You can use any of your past experience or past code for hints.

## Testing

You should be able to develop your code locally with your own code editor and test it using:

```
python3 -m http.server
```

Alternatively, for Python 2:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

## Grading

This problem is worth 50 points.

| Item      | Grade     |
| --------- | --------- |
| Menu bar  | 10 points |
| Top section | 20 points |
| Middle section | 10 points |
| Bottom section | 10 points |

You will get 10 points for each part that looks very close to the design. You will get  7 or 8 or 9 points for getting close, depending on how close it is, and 5 points for having a layout that is far off but shows effort.
